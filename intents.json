The rate of payment is specified in section 53. This payment should be made shortly after termination or quitting, and there are different conditions based on whether the employee worked below or above ground. Notice Period (Section 52(9)): Unused leave should not be considered when calculating the notice period required for terminating an employee's contract. Death of Employee (Section 52(10)): If an employee dies while in service, their heirs are entitled to receive payment for any unused leave at the specified rate, subject to certain conditions depending on whether the employee worked below or above ground."

For core sector, sale of coal is guided by linkages and allocations by the competent authorities.For non-core Sector consumers, with a view to reaching the benefit of decontrol of coal as per Colliery Control Order, 2000, Coal India Limited has decided to authorize its subsidiary companies to formulate their own system and procedure for sale of coal to this sector. The new policy of Coal India Limited is aimed at providing a simplified, transparent and customer-friendly system and procedure. In the new policy framework the system of linkage and sponsorship for the purpose of coal supply to non-core sector is being done away with. In the emerging new policy framework for coal sale to non-core sector, stress is being given on bilateral agreement between supplying subsidiary company and consumer for well defined commitment on the part of both buyer and seller."

      "responses": [
        "The Indian Explosives Act, 1884, classifies explosives into various categories based on their potential danger and use. These categories help regulate and control the handling, storage, transportation, and use of explosives. While the specific classifications may have evolved over time, here are some general categories of explosives that are typically covered by the Indian Explosives Act, 1884: High Explosives, Low Explosives, Blasting Agents, Detonators and Caps, Fireworks and Pyrotechnics, Industrial Explosives & Special Category Explosives. It's important to note that the Indian Explosives Act, 1884, may not use these exact categories but instead defines explosives based on their characteristics and intended use. The specific classification criteria and regulations may be outlined in associated rules and guidelines developed by the authorities responsible for explosives regulation in India. Additionally, the classification of explosives may evolve over time to account for technological advancements and safety considerations."

      "responses": [
        "The Indian Explosives Act, 1884, contains provisions specifically designed to regulate the transportation of explosives within India, prioritizing safety and security. It mandates that individuals or entities involved in transporting explosives obtain licenses or permits explicitly for this purpose, outlining stringent conditions and safety measures. These licenses encompass crucial aspects such as the use of approved containers and packaging materials designed to minimize the risk of accidental detonation or leakage during transit. The act also places significant emphasis on labeling and marking containers and vehicles carrying explosives with clear and conspicuous indicators of the nature of the cargo and associated hazards. Furthermore, it dictates guidelines for the safe segregation of explosives from other cargo to prevent chemical reactions or accidents. The act may require approved transportation routes, specifying restrictions on the passage of explosive materials through densely populated areas or sensitive zones. Additionally, it may necessitate the presence of security personnel or escorts during transportation, especially for high-risk materials, to deter theft, sabotage, or unauthorized access. Emergency response plans are a mandatory component, addressing procedures for handling accidents, spills, fires, or other transportation emergencies. Inspectors authorized by the act have the authority to conduct inspections of vehicles, containers, and transportation practices to ensure strict compliance with safety regulations. Non-compliance may result in penalties or the suspension of transportation licenses. In summary, the Indian Explosives Act, 1884, lays out a comprehensive framework for the safe and secure transportation of explosives within India, encompassing licensing, packaging, labeling, route planning, security, emergency response, and compliance enforcement to mitigate risks and prevent accidents."

      ],
      "responses": [
        "The Indian Explosives Act, 1884, establishes a comprehensive framework of penalties and legal consequences for violations, reflecting the gravity of offenses related to explosives. Violators can face fines, which vary in amount based on the nature and severity of the violation, and imprisonment, with sentences determined by the seriousness of the offense. In addition to these punitive measures, the act empowers authorities to forfeit property used in violations, deterring illegal activities and preventing further misuse of explosives. License revocation or suspension may also be imposed on individuals or entities holding licenses under the act, effectively barring them from engaging in explosives-related activities. Civil liability is a significant aspect, making violators responsible for any damages, injuries, or losses resulting from their actions, leading to compensation claims and financial penalties. Criminal charges may be filed for serious violations, potentially resulting in imprisonment and a criminal record. Injunctions or restraining orders can be issued by courts to prevent further violations, and probation may be imposed, requiring offenders to comply with specified conditions under supervision.

      "responses": [
        "The formulation of the Indian Explosives Act, 1884, can be understood in the historical context of the British colonial period in India. During this time, India was an important colony for the British Empire, and the development of infrastructure, including railways, mining, and construction, led to an increased demand for explosives. However, the misuse and mishandling of explosives posed significant safety and security concerns. Several accidents and incidents highlighted the need for stringent regulations to prevent accidents, safeguard public safety, and curb unauthorized access to explosives. The act was introduced to establish a legal framework for the controlled manufacture, storage, transportation, and use of explosives, addressing these pressing concerns while facilitating legitimate industrial and construction activities."
